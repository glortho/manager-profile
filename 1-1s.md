# 1:1s

- 1:1s are your dedicated time to talk to your primary support staff member (aka manager) about absolutely anything you want to talk about
- You decide when you’d like to meet (though I suggest we try to maintain 50 mins per week — we’ll probably end early sometimes)
- In the vast majority of cases, you set the agenda
- I’m happy to supply ideas for things we can talk about if you want them or don’t otherwise have much of an agenda. For example, this can be a good time for 2-way feedback (though I suggest we try to do that immediately when we have the feedback rather than waiting).
- For most 1:1s we may want to alternate note-taking, but if the subject matter becomes complex or sensitive we should both take notes and compare afterwards to make sure we're on the same page

There are a couple exceptions to the above:

- For our first 1:1 I’ll have an agenda for us to make sure we cover some basic questions and things for us to work on together long-term
- 1:1s are generally not the time for rote task status updates (unless you really want perspective on something)

## Before our first 1:1

#### 1. Create a repo for yourself at https://ghe.io.

- Name it after your handle, for example: https://ghe.io/glortho/glortho.
- Create a project for tracking issues/tasks (call it "Tasks" or whatever you want).
- Make sure to give me write access to your repo.
- We will track notes, docs, reviews, tasks, and more here. Keeping it in a repo that you own will not only help us keep track of everything, but it's then yours forever to do with as you please.
- Let me know when you've done the above and I'll add our first issue/agenda to it!

#### 2. Prepare for me to ask a lot of questions about your life, your career, your hopes and dreams.

- Some of this will be quite personal, not purely professional, so by all means you can and should tell me if you prefer not to talk about any of the subjects I bring up.

## For all 1:1s

- For each meeting, create an issue in the repo you created at https://ghe.io.
- Title the issue something like `2019-01-01 1:1 Meeting`
- Put any known agenda items in the issue before the meeting (ideally at least 24 hrs in advance, but sometimes that's just not possible!)
- We can add notes to the issue during/afterwards.
